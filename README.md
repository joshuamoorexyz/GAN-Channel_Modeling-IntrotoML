### **Project Title**
**Enhancing UAV-to-Ground Channel Modeling for AERPAW Digital Twin Using Generative Adversarial Networks**

---

### **Problem Statement**

The AERPAW digital twin requires accurate wireless channel
models to simulate UAV-to-ground communication in
mobility-driven scenarios. Current statistical models, such
as the 3GPP RMa or Two-Ray Ground Reflection models,
lack the flexibility to adapt to the dynamic and environment-specific
conditions of UAV operations, such as varying altitudes,
Doppler shifts, and multipath effects.

---

### **Proposed Solution**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be employed
to enhance these models by generating context-aware parameters 
(e.g., path loss exponents, Rician K-factors, or shadowing
coefficients) that dynamically adapt to UAV-specific conditions.
By leveraging the dataset provided, which includes
metrics such as CIR, path loss, and Doppler shift, the GAN
can learn patterns unique to UAV channels, offering more
realistic and granular insights to improve the digital twinâ€™s
fidelity.
